# The sentry.io service is used to automatically collect minidumps in case of crashes, it doesn't
# store them after that they are processed but be aware that minidumps will contain memory regions
# used by cachegrand and therefore may they may also contain cached data!
# To avoid accidental/unwanted uploads, by default the dsn is not set to avoid accidental/unwanted
# uploads, if you want to provide crash data without having to attach it to a github issue simply
# set the dsn parameter, or the SENTRY_DSN env variable, to
# https://05dd54814d8149cab65ba2987d560340@o590814.ingest.sentry.io/5740234
